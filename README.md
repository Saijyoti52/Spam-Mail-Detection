# Spam-Mail-Detection
Build a model to detect Spam and ham mails using Naive Bayes algorithm.
Na√Øve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.
Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets.
